# Stupid Bullets

Why are all these pesky things taking up space on your islands? Clear it off with your trusty BlunderBust 3000 and knock everything off the edge of the world. 

Unless of course you just have a bunch of random, stupid bullets.

A short game in which you must clear the area of all that pesky junk: Trash, Cars, Animals, Graves, Weird Mannequin Cults, and everything else totally normal to clean up.
